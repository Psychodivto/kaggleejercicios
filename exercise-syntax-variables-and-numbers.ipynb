This course will cover the fundamental Python skills that youâ€™ll need before jumping in to using Python for data science. These lessons are aimed at those with some previous coding experience who are looking to add Python to their repertoire or level up their Python skills. (If you're a first-time coder, you may find this course a bit too fast-paced. You may want to check out [these \"Python for Non-Programmers\" learning resources](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).)\n\nThis first lesson will cover a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, you may want to [skip straight to the exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1275163).\n\n> These lessons borrow and adapt some content from [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/whirlwind-tour-of-python-index).

Subsequent lines which are **indented** (beginning with an extra 4 spaces) are part of that code block. You may be familiar with other languages which use `{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace often is surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. \n\nThe later lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we start defining functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:\n\n```python\n\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n```\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks.
