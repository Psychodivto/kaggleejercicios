    "Welcome to Kaggle Learn's Python course. This course will cover the fundamental Python skills that youâ€™ll need before jumping in to using Python for data science. These lessons are aimed at those with some previous coding experience who are looking to add Python to their repertoire or level up their Python skills. (If you're a first-time coder, you may find this course a bit too fast-paced. You may want to check out [these \"Python for Non-Programmers\" learning resources](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).)\n",

    "This first lesson will cover a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, you may want to [skip straight to the exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1275163).\n",
